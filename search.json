    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the oldest myths in basketball is “You live by the three, you die by the three,” and that’s the way the game was played for about the first 40 years of the three-point line. Teams never wanted to become too reliant on it instead opting for mid-range and paint shots that people could make at a higher percentage.\nThe three-point line was first introduced in the 1979-1980 season. Since then it has remained relatively untouched except for a brief stint from 1994-1997 when they moved it in then back out again.\nIn 2015 however the Warriors and their star guard Stephen Curry opened the publics eyes to what was already happening for years behind the scenes in the NBA.\n\nTeams where taking more and more 3-pointers and had been for years, however, no one seemed to notice until the team led by the small guard who shot a bunch of threes put an end to the whole “You live by the three, you die by the three,” line by winning a championship by primarily shooting threes.\nCurry and the Warriors were not the first team to shoot a lot of threes analytics based teams and coaches like Mike D’Antoni and his Suns and Rockets teams had traveled that road before. However, the Warriors were the first to win while doing it. Fast forward to 2024 and it seems like teams are racing to see who can get up the most deep shots before the buzzer sounds.\nTV hosts and former players say it’s bad for the game and every team plays alike now. On the other hand, teams analytics departments are pleading with players and coaches to take as many shots from behind the arc as possible.\nBut does shooting more threes lead to winning? In this piece, I will be looking at past NBA seasons to get a sense of if teams are right to shoot more threes or if it’s become a trend that’s hurting the league.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nThreepluswin &lt;- read_csv(\"threepluswin24.csv\")\n\nTPW &lt;- Threepluswin |&gt;\nselect(Team, `3P`,`3PA`,`3P%`,Wins)\n\nCTPW24 &lt;- TPW |&gt;\nfilter(Team == \"Bos Celtics24\")\n\nNTPW23 &lt;- TPW |&gt;\nfilter(Team == \"Den Nuggets23\")\n\nWTPW22 &lt;- TPW |&gt;\nfilter(Team == \"GS Warriors22\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=TPW, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=CTPW24, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=CTPW24, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, label=Team) )+\n  geom_point(\n    data=NTPW23, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"gold\")+ \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=NTPW23, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, label=Team) )+    \n       geom_point(\n    data=WTPW22, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=WTPW22, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, label=Team))+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 34.83) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 12.5)+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(9,18 ))+\n geom_text(aes(x=34.83, label=\"League Average 3's Taken\", y=14.5, label=\"League Average 3's Made\"), color=\"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x=40.5, y=18, label=\"More 3's Taken, More 3's Made\"), color=\"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x=31.5, y=9, label=\"Less 3's Take, Less 3's Made\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Three Point Attempts Per Game\", \n    y=\"Three Point Makes Per Game\", \n    title=\"The best teams take and make more threes\", \n    subtitle=\"Two of the last three NBA champions have taken and made way more threes than the avearge team.\", \n    caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year’s Boston Celtics and the 2022 Golden State Warriors are prime examples of the modern NBA as both teams were extremely liberal in taking as many threes as possible. The Celtics lost to the Warriors in the 2022 NBA Finals under then coach Ime Udoka.\nIn 2024 the Celtics had a new coach former West Virginia basketball player Joe Mazzulla who brought with him a new philosophy. Under Coach Mazzula the Celtics averaged a league-high 42.5 shots attempted from deep per game three more than any other team in the league.\nThe 2022 Warriors championship team was led by one of the best shooting trio’s of all time Curry, Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole who combined for 28.6 long balls attempted per game just .2 less than the Chicago Bulls.\nThe 2023 Nuggets are an exception to the rules for many reasons, however their low three-point attempts is a rare zag in history as most teams increasing their three-point attempts year after year.\n\n\nCode\nLATotals &lt;- read_csv(\"leagueavgtotals.csv\")\nLATotals3PAT &lt;- LATotals |&gt;\nselect(Year, `3P`,`3PA`,`3P%`)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3PA`), \n    color = \"gold\"\n  )+\n    geom_point(\n    data=LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x=2012, y=1213, label=\"Lock out season\"), \n    color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x=2020, y=2408, label=\"Covid\"), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x=2021, y=2494, label=\"Covid\"), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2000,2024 ))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(900,2900 )) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Average total team 3-point attempts\", \n    title=\"Teams have been taking more threes since 2000.\", \n    subtitle=\"The last quarter centruy has has been a 3-point reveloution in the NBA, except for the &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;lock out&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; seasons.\", \n    caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average team today are approaching nearly 2,000 more shots beyond the arc than the average team at the turn of the century. Every year the total number of threes has gone up with the exception of the lock out season where teams only played 66 games and the two COVID seasons which where 71 and 72 games.\nSince teams are for sure taking more threes they are obviously making more, however, one would think that the more threes you take the lower your percentage of threes you make.\n\n\nCode\nLAVG &lt;- read_csv(\"leagueavg.csv\")\n\nLAVG3 &lt;- LAVG |&gt;\nselect(Year, `3P`,`3PA`,`3P%`)\n\nY25 &lt;- LAVG |&gt; \n  filter(Year == \"2025\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=LAVG3, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3PA`), weight=`3PA`))  +\n  geom_bar(data=Y25, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3PA`), weight=`3PA`), fill=\"gold\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n   labs(title=\"The NBA is valuing volume over percentage\", \n       subtitle = \"Teams accross the NBA are taking and making more threes than ever.\",  \n       x=\"\", y=\"NBA average 3-pointers shot per game\", \n       caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=LAVG3, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P`), weight=`3P`))  +\n  geom_bar(data=Y25, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P`), weight=`3P`), fill=\"gold\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title = \"\", \n       subtitle= \"\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"NBA average 3-pointers made per game\",  \n       caption=\"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=LAVG3, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P%`), weight=`3P%`))  +\n  geom_bar(data=Y25, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P%`), weight=`3P%`), fill=\"gold\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n   labs(title = \"\", \n       subtitle= \"\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"NBA average 3-point percentage\",  \n       caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\nbar1 + bar2 + bar3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is partially true with the 2025 season being the most threes teams have ever taken while being middle of the pack compared to the last few seasons in three-point percentage, there is a catch. Overall, the NBA average three-point shooting percentage has remained between 34.7 and 36.7 since 2000. Recent years like 2024 and 2021 are actually top three shooting years along with an all-time hot shooting year in 2009.\nSo does shooting more threes actually lead to more wins?\nWell seven of the last nine NBA champions have shot at or above the league average in three-point attempts per game. The only exceptions were the 2023 Nuggets who didn’t have the personnel to shoot a ton of threes and the 2020 Lakers which happened during the bubble.\nTeams clearly see the value of shooting from behind the arc as they keep increasing their attempts. The reigning NBA Champion Celtics are at the forefront once again this season as they have shot a jaw dropping 51.4 attempts from deep so far this season.\nWhile chucking up a thousand threes a game won’t guarantee you the win the more you take within reason the greater your chance of winning is.\nTV hosts and former players may have a point that the on-screen product is beginning to look very similar as every team seems to take a bunch of threes every game.\nHowever, as long as shooting from long range is leading to winning teams are sure to keep increasing their attempts just as they’ve done in the past."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the NBA’s 78-year history, there have been some pretty awful trades. You have teams like the Hornets, Hawks and Super Sonics giving away players like Kobe Bryant, Bill Russell and Scottie Pippen on draft night. Then you have teams like the Bucks and 76ers, who practically gave the Lakers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain.\nMost of the league’s truly horrific robberies and swindles can be traced back to the early days of the NBA, where the rules were drastically different and the precedent for idiocy had yet to be firmly cemented. While many bad trades happened in the past, recent NBA history is not exempt from its fair share of absolute blunders.\nThe Thunder traded James Harden over a few million dollars they would’ve had if they just waited. The Lakers shipped out the few remaining role players from their 2020 Championship team for an old Russell Westbrook.\nThen you have the Nets, with perhaps the biggest blunder of them all sending their entire future (four first-round picks) to the Celtics for the partial remanence of the “Big Three” of Kevin Garnett (age 37), Paul Pierce (36) and Jason Terry (36). I mean, they didn’t even get Ray Allen in the deal. To make matters worse, the picks turned into Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and helped the Celtics get Kyrie.\nThe aftermath of that deal taught teams that mortgaging the future for stars is a risky game that can set franchises back years if not decades. The following years would still have some lopsided trades, however, nowhere near the extent of the Nets debacle.\nThat was until the summer of 2019 when the Oklahoma City Thunder got bounced from the playoffs early once again and the Clippers had a reason to make a deal. Today I will be looking at one of the worst trades of the last decade in the NBA if not all of NBA History in the 2019 Clippers and Thunder deal.\nThe early playoff exit prompted Russel Westbrook to ask out and subsequently his co-star Paul George who had finished third in MVP voting that season. The Clippers came calling fist for George as they had a subsequent deal to land then reigning NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard that hinged on their ability to get George in the fray.\nThe Clippers had a relatively new and fairly aggressive owner Steve Ballmer who came with deep pockets from his days at Microsoft and he came with an offer that general manager Sam Presti couldn’t refuse.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntradedetails &lt;- read_csv(\"tradedetails.csv\")\n\ntradedetails |&gt; gt()|&gt; \ncols_label(\n    `Thunder Receive` = \"Thunder Receive\",\n    `Clippers Receive` = \"Clippers Receive\"\n  ) |&gt;\ntab_header (\n  title= \"Trade Details\",\n  subtitle= \"Details of the 2019 Summer Blockbuster trade between the Thunder and the Clippers.\"\n) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: NBA.com \") ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade Details\n\n\nDetails of the 2019 Summer Blockbuster trade between the Thunder and the Clippers.\n\n\nThunder Receive\nClippers Receive\n\n\n\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\nPaul George\n\n\nDanilo Gallinari\nNA\n\n\nMiami Heat’s 2021 unprotected first (Tre Mann taken at No. 18)\nNA\n\n\nClippers’ 2022 unprotected first (Jalen Williams taken at No. 12)\nNA\n\n\nClippers' 2023 first-round swap (not conveyed)\nNA\n\n\nClippers’ 2024 unprotected first (Dillon Jones taken at No. 26)\nNA\n\n\nHeat’s 2025 protected first 1-14 (unprotected for 2026)\nNA\n\n\nClippers' 2025 first-round swap\nNA\n\n\nClippers’ 2026 unprotected first-rounder\nNA\n\n\n\nBy: Cameron King | Source: NBA.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresti had been at the helm for the disaster that was the James Harden deal that eventually led to the dissolution of the first iteration of the Thunder “Big Three” of Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook and James Harden. While that was definitely a low point in his career he had bounced back and grown to become one of the best general managers in all of sports.\nThis trade cemented his status as one of the toughest negotiators in sports as he turned a distressed and depreciating asset into a war chest of future picks and flexibility.\nAt the time the trade was perceived to be a win-win for both teams however as the Clippers gained a newfound relevance that had evaded them for the vast majority of the team’s history. The Thunder on the other hand got a future with the picks and a promising young player in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander a six-foot-six lengthy guard out of Kentucky who has a history of producing great NBA guards.\nHowever, it wouldn’t take long for perception to change as time went on Gilgeous-Alexander proved to be better than expected while Paul George regressed ever so slightly with age. To make matters worse the Thunder started to hit on some of the picks that they got out of the deal which came in earlier in the draft than expected thanks to a few injury-riddled Clippers seasons.\n\n\nCode\ntrade &lt;- read_csv(\"trade.csv\")\n\ntradeparts &lt;- trade |&gt;\nselect(Year, Player, Team, PTS, TRB, AST, STL, BLK, YearTeam)\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=tradeparts, aes(x=reorder(Year, PTS), weight=PTS, fill=Team)) +\n   labs(title=\"The Thunder won the trade\", \n       subtitle = \"The Thunder have gotten more production from the trade across the board.\",  \n       x=\"\", y=\"Points Per Game\", \n       caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \ngeom_bar(data=tradeparts, aes(x=reorder(Year, TRB), weight=TRB, fill=Team)) +\n  labs(title = \"\", \n       subtitle= \"\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"Rebounds Per Game\",  \n       caption=\"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + \ngeom_bar(data=tradeparts, aes(x=reorder(Year, STL), weight=STL, fill=Team)) +\n  labs(title = \"\", \n       subtitle= \"\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"Steals Per Game\",  \n       caption=\"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\nbar4 &lt;- ggplot() + \ngeom_bar(data=tradeparts, aes(x=reorder(Year, AST), weight=AST, fill=Team)) +\n   labs(title = \"\", \n       subtitle= \"\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"Assits Per Game\",  \n       caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\nbar1 + bar2 + bar3 + bar4 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFast forward to the present day, and if it was boxing, it would be a unanimous decision or a brutal knockout in favor of the Thunder. While it started close the Thunder took Jalen Williams 12th in the 2022 NBA draft and Shai elevated into a whole different MVP esc stratosphere.\nThe Clippers had traded away a 30-plus point-per-game scorer and (unknowingly granted) a rising star in Jalen Williams who would start on any NBA team today.\nHowever, if you had gone back in time and told the Clippers this when the trade happened, they might have hesitated, but they most likely still go through with it to get Kawhi and Paul George to LA in Clipper uniforms. Kawhi was threatening to take his talents upstairs who had their super team of LeBron James and Anthony Davis. This would have spelled indefinite irrelevancy for the Clippers and likely put an end to any new arena talks that were in the works.\nUnfortunately, Paul George and Kawhi Leonard would endure several serious injuries, and brutal playoff collapses over the next few years with only a trip to the second round to show for it all. To make matters worse Paul and the Clippers would part ways before the start of the 2025 season officially ending the debate for the very few die-hard Clippers holdouts.\nIn the Clipper’s defense, however, there is no way they could’ve known what the picks would turn into, and if other teams were a little bit smarter there is no way Jalen Williams falls to 12, and Tre Mann is already with his second team. So, if you take all the picks out of it and don’t count Danilo Gallinari, who had a short stint in OKC after the trade, how does just Shai and George stack up since the trade?\n\n\nCode\nSGAvPG &lt;- read_csv(\"sgavspg.csv\")\n\nSGAvPG |&gt; gt()|&gt; \ncols_label(\n    `Shai Gilgeous-Alexander` = \"Shai Gilgeous-Alexander\",\n    `Paul George` = \"Paul George\"\n  ) |&gt;\ntab_header (\n  title= \"Shai Gilegeous-Alexander Has Been The Better Player\",\n  subtitle= \"SGA has provided far more value to the team he was traded to than Paul George has and the gap is only getting bigger.\"\n) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    rows = c(7, 8, 10, 11),\n    decimals = 2\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"orange\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Stats == \"Total Win Shares\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"lightblue\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Stats == \"Total Games Played\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShai Gilegeous-Alexander Has Been The Better Player\n\n\nSGA has provided far more value to the team he was traded to than Paul George has and the gap is only getting bigger.\n\n\nStats\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander\nPaul George\n\n\n\n\nPoints Per Game\n26.5\n23.0\n\n\nAssists Per Game\n4.6\n4.5\n\n\nRebounds Per Game\n5.2\n6.0\n\n\nSteals Per Game\n1.4\n1.5\n\n\nBlocks Per Game\n1.0\n0.4\n\n\nTotal Games Played\n304.0\n263.0\n\n\nField Goal%\n49.90%\n45.50%\n\n\nThree Point%\n34.40%\n39.70%\n\n\nPlayer Efficiency Rating\n24.0\n19.8\n\n\nTrue Shooting%\n60.60%\n59.00%\n\n\nUsage%\n30.00%\n29.30%\n\n\nTotal Win Shares\n44.7\n23.2\n\n\nTotal Value Over Replacement\n21.7\n12.5\n\n\nPlus/Minus\n5.6\n3.6\n\n\n\nBy: Cameron King | Source: basketball-reference.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nOuch. Gilgeous-Alexander has been better in almost every statistical category that you would want to look at. He’s averaged more points, assists and blocks despite being shorter while having a better field goal percentage. The advanced numbers are even more of a blowout as Shai has been more efficient while contributing over 20 more win shares (basically wins because of him). He also is way more valuable than his backup then Paul George has been during their period with their respective teams.\nIn a vacuum the trade is hard to defend for the Clippers however, teams make several moves every season to win as many games as possible (for most teams anyway). How have the two franchises faired since the deal?\n\n\nCode\nteamwins &lt;- read_csv(\"teamwins.csv\")\n\nThunder &lt;- teamwins |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"OKC Thunder\")\n\nClips &lt;- teamwins |&gt; \n  filter(Team == \"LA Clippers\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = Thunder, \n    aes(x = Year, y = Wins), \n    color = \"orange\"\n  )+\n    geom_point(\n    data=Thunder, \n    aes(x=2019.5, y=46.5, label=\"Trade\"), \n    color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_line(\n    data = Clips, \n    aes(x = Year, y = Wins), \n    color = \"red\"\n  )+\n    geom_point(\n    data=Clips, \n    aes(x=2019.5, y=48.5, label=\"Trade\"), \n    color=\"blue\") + \n   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(20,60 )) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n    title=\"The Clippers have won more games.\", \n    subtitle=\"While the &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;Clippers&lt;/span&gt; may have lost the &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;trade&lt;/span&gt; they have consistently won more games than the &lt;span style = 'color:orange;'&gt;Thunder&lt;/span&gt; in the seasons since.\", \n    caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne could argue the Clippers fell into the sweet spot for NBA teams. Good enough to keep fans interested and the team is profitable but not so good that it becomes ridiculously expensive. However, the Clippers were paying millions upon millions of dollars in luxury tax while hovering around good to not quite great team status.\nOn top of all that the new arena that was part of the urgency for the trade is built and it’s known as the $2 billion Intuit Dome. With Paul George now residing in Philadelphia and Kawhi Leonard hurt the Clippers have nothing to show for the dreaded 2019 transaction at the moment.\nThe Thunder on the other hand were shockingly good in the first-year post-trade as a motivated Chris Paul who they acquired by trading Russel Westbrook refused to let his playoffs-made streak die in Oklahoma. Ultimately the Thunder would flip him to for more pieces the next year and proceed to the deep dark depths of the NBA where they quite frankly wanted to be.\nHowever, they wouldn’t stay there long as Gilgeous-Alexander continued to rise they drafted Jalen Williams and a seven-foot skinny kid that can shoot in Chet Holmgren giving them a new “Big Three”. The Thunder are now one of the best teams in the league and the betting favorite to represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals.\nLooking forward the Clippers are not done paying for their sins of 2019 as they still owe the Thunder a 2025 protected pick from the Heat, their 2026 unprotected first and the Thunder have the right to swap first-round picks in 2025.\nThis is especially dreadful becasue according to scouts both the 2025 and 2026 classes are two of the best and deepest classes in recent history. With prospects like AJ Dybansta, Cooper Flagg, Cam Boozer and Darryn Peterson inbound this trade has the potential to go from worst in a decade to worst ever.\nWhile it may not be the worst trade ever yet thanks to some utterly mind-boggling thefts of the past it stands alone as the worst trade since the Nets trade in 2013. Unlike in 2013 and the years after teams today seem almost eager to enter their hats in the race with new bad trades popping up more and more frequently thanks to the restrictions in the new CBA. While misery loves company the Clippers fans will still likely look back at 2019 and get sick to their stomachs, especially every time they play the Thunder look to be perineal contenders thanks to the Clipper’s donation."
