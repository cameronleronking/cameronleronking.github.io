    "text": "One of the oldest myths in basketball is “You live by the three, you die by the three,” and that’s the way the game was played for about the first 40 years of the three-point line. Teams never wanted to become too reliant on it instead opting for mid-range and paint shots that people could make at a higher percentage.\nThe three-point line was first introduced in the 1979-1980 season. Since then it has remained relatively untouched except for a brief stint from 1994-1997 when they moved it in then back out again.\nIn 2015 however the Warriors and their star guard Stephen Curry opened the publics eyes to what was already happening for years behind the scenes in the NBA.\n\nTeams where taking more and more 3-pointers and had been for years, however, no one seemed to notice until the team led by the small guard who shot a bunch of threes put an end to the whole “You live by the three, you die by the three,” line by winning a championship by primarily shooting threes.\nCurry and the Warriors were not the first team to shoot a lot of threes analytics based teams and coaches like Mike D’Antoni and his Suns and Rockets teams had traveled that road before. However, the Warriors were the first to win while doing it. Fast forward to 2024 and it seems like teams are racing to see who can get up the most deep shots before the buzzer sounds.\nTV hosts and former players say it’s bad for the game and every team plays alike now. On the other hand, teams analytics departments are pleading with players and coaches to take as many shots from behind the arc as possible.\nBut does shooting more threes lead to winning? In this piece, I will be looking at past NBA seasons to get a sense of if teams are right to shoot more threes or if it’s become a trend that’s hurting the league.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nThreepluswin &lt;- read_csv(\"threepluswin24.csv\")\n\nTPW &lt;- Threepluswin |&gt;\nselect(Team, `3P`,`3PA`,`3P%`,Wins)\n\nCTPW24 &lt;- TPW |&gt;\nfilter(Team == \"Bos Celtics24\")\n\nNTPW23 &lt;- TPW |&gt;\nfilter(Team == \"Den Nuggets23\")\n\nWTPW22 &lt;- TPW |&gt;\nfilter(Team == \"GS Warriors22\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=TPW, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=CTPW24, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=CTPW24, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, label=Team) )+\n  geom_point(\n    data=NTPW23, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"gold\")+ \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=NTPW23, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, label=Team) )+    \n       geom_point(\n    data=WTPW22, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, size=Wins), \n    color=\"gold\") + \n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=WTPW22, \n    aes(x=`3PA`, y=`3P`, label=Team))+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 34.83) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 12.5)+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(9,18 ))+\n geom_text(aes(x=34.83, label=\"League Average 3's Taken\", y=14.5, label=\"League Average 3's Made\"), color=\"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x=40.5, y=18, label=\"More 3's Taken, More 3's Made\"), color=\"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x=31.5, y=9, label=\"Less 3's Take, Less 3's Made\"), color=\"black\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Three Point Attempts Per Game\", \n    y=\"Three Point Makes Per Game\", \n    title=\"The best teams take and make more threes\", \n    subtitle=\"Two of the last three NBA champions have taken and made way more threes than the avearge team.\", \n    caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year’s Boston Celtics and the 2022 Golden State Warriors are prime examples of the modern NBA as both teams were extremely liberal in taking as many threes as possible. The Celtics lost to the Warriors in the 2022 NBA Finals under then coach Ime Udoka.\nIn 2024 the Celtics had a new coach former West Virginia basketball player Joe Mazzulla who brought with him a new philosophy. Under Coach Mazzula the Celtics averaged a league-high 42.5 shots attempted from deep per game three more than any other team in the league.\nThe 2022 Warriors championship team was led by one of the best shooting trio’s of all time Curry, Klay Thompson and Jordan Poole who combined for 28.6 long balls attempted per game just .2 less than the Chicago Bulls.\nThe 2023 Nuggets are an exception to the rules for many reasons, however their low three-point attempts is a rare zag in history as most teams increasing their three-point attempts year after year.\n\n\nCode\nLATotals &lt;- read_csv(\"leagueavgtotals.csv\")\nLATotals3PAT &lt;- LATotals |&gt;\nselect(Year, `3P`,`3PA`,`3P%`)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    data = LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x = Year, y = `3PA`), \n    color = \"gold\"\n  )+\n    geom_point(\n    data=LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x=2012, y=1213, label=\"Lock out season\"), \n    color=\"blue\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x=2020, y=2408, label=\"Covid\"), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_point(\n    data=LATotals3PAT, \n    aes(x=2021, y=2494, label=\"Covid\"), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2000,2024 ))+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(900,2900 )) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Year\", \n    y=\"Average total team 3-point attempts\", \n    title=\"Teams have been taking more threes since 2000.\", \n    subtitle=\"The last quarter centruy has has been a 3-point reveloution in the NBA, except for the &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;lock out&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;COVID&lt;/span&gt; seasons.\", \n    caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 7), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=9), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average team today are approaching nearly 2,000 more shots beyond the arc than the average team at the turn of the century. Every year the total number of threes has gone up with the exception of the lock out season where teams only played 66 games and the two COVID seasons which where 71 and 72 games.\nSince teams are for sure taking more threes they are obviously making more, however, one would think that the more threes you take the lower your percentage of threes you make.\n\n\nCode\nLAVG &lt;- read_csv(\"leagueavg.csv\")\n\nLAVG3 &lt;- LAVG |&gt;\nselect(Year, `3P`,`3PA`,`3P%`)\n\nY25 &lt;- LAVG |&gt; \n  filter(Year == \"2025\")\n\nbar1 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=LAVG3, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3PA`), weight=`3PA`))  +\n  geom_bar(data=Y25, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3PA`), weight=`3PA`), fill=\"gold\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n   labs(title=\"The NBA is valuing volume over percentage\", \n       subtitle = \"Teams accross the NBA are taking and making more threes than ever.\",  \n       x=\"\", y=\"NBA average 3-pointers shot per game\", \n       caption = \"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\nbar2 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=LAVG3, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P`), weight=`3P`))  +\n  geom_bar(data=Y25, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P`), weight=`3P`), fill=\"gold\") +\n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(title = \"\", \n       subtitle= \"\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"NBA average 3-pointers made per game\",  \n       caption=\"\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\nbar3 &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=LAVG3, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P%`), weight=`3P%`))  +\n  geom_bar(data=Y25, aes(x=reorder(Year, `3P%`), weight=`3P%`), fill=\"gold\") +\n  coord_flip()+ \n   labs(title = \"\", \n       subtitle= \"\", \n       x=\"\", y=\"NBA average 3-point percentage\",  \n       caption=\"By: Cameron King  |  Source: basketball-reference.com \") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\nbar1 + bar2 + bar3 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is partially true with the 2025 season being the most threes teams have ever taken while being middle of the pack compared to the last few seasons in three-point percentage, there is a catch. Overall, the NBA average three-point shooting percentage has remained between 34.7 and 36.7 since 2000. Recent years like 2024 and 2021 are actually top three shooting years along with an all-time hot shooting year in 2009.\nSo does shooting more threes actually lead to more wins?\nWell seven of the last nine NBA champions have shot at or above the league average in three-point attempts per game. The only exceptions were the 2023 Nuggets who didn’t have the personnel to shoot a ton of threes and the 2020 Lakers which happened during the bubble.\nTeams clearly see the value of shooting from behind the arc as they keep increasing their attempts. The reigning NBA Champion Celtics are at the forefront once again this season as they have shot a jaw dropping 51.4 attempts from deep so far this season.\nWhile chucking up a thousand threes a game won’t guarantee you the win the more you take within reason the greater your chance of winning is.\nTV hosts and former players may have a point that the on-screen product is beginning to look very similar as every team seems to take a bunch of threes every game.\nHowever, as long as shooting from long range is leading to winning teams are sure to keep increasing their attempts just as they’ve done in the past."
